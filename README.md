Welcome to my first GitHub repository! This is where I practice and learn GitHub features, including creating repositories, managing files, and using Git commands.

## Purpose
- To explore GitHub and understand how it works.
- To practice writing and formatting README files.
- To experiment with version control concepts like commits, branches, and pull requests.

## What You'll Find Here
- **Notes:** Documentation of my learning process and concepts I’ve studied.
- **Code Snippets:** Small programs and code examples for practice.
- **Markdown Practice:** Experiments with Markdown formatting (like this README!).

## Why I Created This
As a beginner, I want to familiarize myself with GitHub and version control. This repository is a playground where I can make mistakes and learn along the way.

## Next Steps
1. Learn basic Git commands.
2. Explore branching and merging.
3. Create a simple project (even if it’s just a calculator or a to-do list app).
